## Problem Statement 4 : AI-Powered GDPR Compliance & Personal Data Protection for Nordic Software Ecosystems

Nordic organizations handle vast amounts of personal data through digital
platforms in healthcare, retail, housing, and citizen services. With the EU’s
GDPR and local data laws, ensuring privacy and compliance has become
both critical and complex.
Many companies lack visibility into where sensitive information (like names,
health data, and national IDs) is stored across apps, logs, and cloud systems.
Manual audits and static policies can’t keep pace with the volume and velocity of
data.
This creates major risks — from data breaches and consent violations to
multimillion-euro GDPR fines and loss of public trust.
Identity systems are also fragmented: while BankID, MitID, and Suomi.fi exist,
most software platforms don’t intelligently manage user identity or data flow
between them.
There’s a growing need for AI-driven solutions that can automatically detect,
classify, and anonymize PII, identify security gaps, and continuously monitor
compliance across digital ecosystems.
Nordic companies need proactive, intelligent privacy protection that aligns with
regional trust culture and EU-level data regulations — not reactive, manual
compliance.
